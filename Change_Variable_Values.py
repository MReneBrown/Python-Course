#  ^^^ Redfinition of second type from str to float
# the warning states is that we've redefined the 
# second type from a string into a float. In a 
# real-world application you could have called a 
# method on second by making sure the format is 
# correctly set up with a capital letter in the 
# first name, etc. Had you done this and accidentally 
# set it as a float (the batting average), your 
# program would run into an error because the expected 
# type is not what has been received. Considered poor practice.
